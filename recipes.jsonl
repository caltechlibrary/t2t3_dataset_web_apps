Preheat oven to 325°F (170°C).\n2. Dry toast the chopped pecans until fragrant and slightly colored.\nThis can either be done in a dry skillet on the stovetop over medium-high heat\nwhile stirring frequently or else by roasting the nuts in the oven on a\ncookie sheet while you prepare the batter. The stovetop method is faster but\nrequires more attention. It is also possible to buy dry toasted nuts instead of\nraw to avoid this step. The pecans should be crunchy and nutty, not rubbery or mealy.\n3. In a small bowl stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.\n4. In a large bowl, stir the melted butter, brown sugar, and vanilla until uniform,\nbreaking up any large lumps of sugar.\n5. Beat in egg until creamy.\n6. Gently fold in flour mixture. When flour is nearly incorporated, gently fold in\ntoasted pecans. Do not overmix.\n7. Spread mixture into buttered 8 x 8-inch (20 x 20 cm) baking dish.\n8. Bake at 325°F (170°C) for 30 minutes or until desired doneness.\n9. Let cool and cut into bars.\n"}}

{"key":"frybread","object":{"ingredients":"backing powder,2 tsp\nflour,2 cups\nhot water,⅔ cups\nsalt,1 tsp salt\nshortening,2 Tbsp","key":"frybread","name":"Fry Bread","procedure":"1. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.\n2. Use a pastry blender (or two butter knives) to cut the shortening into the flour.\n3. Add the hot water, and mix until the water is incorporated and you get a dough.\n4. Turn out the dough on a lightly floured board. Knead the dough until it is soft and smooth.\n5. Wrap the dough in plastic, and let the dough rest for 30 minutes.\n6. Divide the dough into 6 pieces, roll each into a ball, and roll each into a flat disk with a rolling pin.\n7. Brush one side of each disk with melted margarine and place on a barbecue over a 3 Mississippi fire.\n8. Brush the opposing side of the bread with margarine and flip the bread on the barbecue.\n9. Cook until both sides are golden brown. Serve hot.\n\n- You can substitute either ¼ cup plain yogurt, or a ¼ cup soured milk as a leavening agent\ninstead of baking powder. If you do, add 2 hours to the rest time for the dough, and leave\nthe dough somewhere warm. You can optionally include the baking powder as well to get a\nvery puffy version of frybread. If using yogurt or soured milk for leavening, use ½ cup\ninstead of ⅓ cup water.\n- You can use mayonnaise in place of shortening for a crispy, crunchier texture.\n- You can also fry the dough in hot oil over a stovetop. The dough cooks rapidly and will brown\nin about 12 seconds and must be turned over to allow the opposite side to brown, then be removed\nfrom the oil and placed sideways into a colander or large bowl lined with paper towels to allow\nthe oil to drain off the finished product\n\nurl: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Fry_Bread_I\n"}}

Use a vegetable brush to scrub the taro root under cold, running water. Do not peel.\n2. In a large pot, cover taro with cold water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer and cook until taro can be pierced easily with a fork. Drain and rinse with cold water.\n3. Peel the cooked taro and cut into small pieces. Using 2 cups at a time, put the cooked taro into a food processor bowl.\n4. Add a tablespoon of water and process until smooth. The consistency should be sticky and thick enough to stick to one finger. (Adding more water will produce “three finger poi”.)\n5. Rinse a non-reactive bowl (typically made of silicone or stainless steel) with cold water and transfer the mixture to the bowl. Slowly pour a thin layer of cool water on top of the poi and cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel.\n6. Allow the mixture to sit at a cool room temperature for 2-4 days.
