Blondies

baking powder,1 tsp
chopped pecans,¾ cup (180 g)
egg,1
firmly packed dark brown sugar,1 cup (240 g)
flour,1 cup (125 g)
melted unsalted butter,cup (120 g)
salt,¾ tsp
vanilla extract,1 tbsp
 
1. Preheat oven to 325°F (170°C).
2. Dry toast the chopped pecans until fragrant and slightly colored.
This can either be done in a dry skillet on the stovetop over medium-high heat
while stirring frequently or else by roasting the nuts in the oven on a
cookie sheet while you prepare the batter. The stovetop method is faster but
requires more attention. It is also possible to buy dry toasted nuts instead of
raw to avoid this step. The pecans should be crunchy and nutty, not rubbery or mealy.
3. In a small bowl stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
4. In a large bowl, stir the melted butter, brown sugar, and vanilla until uniform,
breaking up any large lumps of sugar.
5. Beat in egg until creamy.
6. Gently fold in flour mixture. When flour is nearly incorporated, gently fold in
toasted pecans. Do not overmix.
7. Spread mixture into buttered 8 x 8-inch (20 x 20 cm) baking dish.
8. Bake at 325°F (170°C) for 30 minutes or until desired doneness.
9. Let cool and cut into bars.
