Fry Bread

backing powder,2 tsp
flour,2 cups
hot water,⅔ cups
salt,1 tsp salt
shortening,2 Tbsp

1. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.
2. Use a pastry blender (or two butter knives) to cut the shortening into the flour.
3. Add the hot water, and mix until the water is incorporated and you get a dough.
4. Turn out the dough on a lightly floured board. Knead the dough until it is soft and smooth.
5. Wrap the dough in plastic, and let the dough rest for 30 minutes.
6. Divide the dough into 6 pieces, roll each into a ball, and roll each into a flat disk with a rolling pin.
7. Brush one side of each disk with melted margarine and place on a barbecue over a 3 Mississippi fire.
8. Brush the opposing side of the bread with margarine and flip the bread on the barbecue.
9. Cook until both sides are golden brown. Serve hot.

- You can substitute either ¼ cup plain yogurt, or a ¼ cup soured milk as a leavening agent
instead of baking powder. If you do, add 2 hours to the rest time for the dough, and leave
the dough somewhere warm. You can optionally include the baking powder as well to get a
very puffy version of frybread. If using yogurt or soured milk for leavening, use ½ cup
instead of ⅓ cup water.
- You can use mayonnaise in place of shortening for a crispy, crunchier texture.
- You can also fry the dough in hot oil over a stovetop. The dough cooks rapidly and will brown
in about 12 seconds and must be turned over to allow the opposite side to brown, then be removed
from the oil and placed sideways into a colander or large bowl lined with paper towels to allow
the oil to drain off the finished product
