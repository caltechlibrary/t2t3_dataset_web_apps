Poi

Ingredients,Units
Taro, 1 to 2
Water


Steps:

1. Use a vegetable brush to scrub the taro root under cold, running water. Do not peel.
2. In a large pot, cover taro with cold water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer and cook until taro can be pierced easily with a fork. Drain and rinse with cold water.
3. Peel the cooked taro and cut into small pieces. Using 2 cups at a time, put the cooked taro into a food processor bowl.
4. Add a tablespoon of water and process until smooth. The consistency should be sticky and thick enough to stick to one finger. (Adding more water will produce “three finger poi”.)
5. Rinse a non-reactive bowl (typically made of silicone or stainless steel) with cold water and transfer the mixture to the bowl. Slowly pour a thin layer of cool water on top of the poi and cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel.
6. Allow the mixture to sit at a cool room temperature for 2-4 days. (optional, this step allows the poi to ferment and become sour)
